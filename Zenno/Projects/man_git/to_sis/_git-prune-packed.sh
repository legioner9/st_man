 NAME 
 
 
 git-prune-packed - Remove extra objects that are already in pack files 
 
 
 
 
 SYNOPSIS 
 
 
 git prune-packed  [-n|--dry-run] [-q|--quiet] 
 
 
 
 
 DESCRIPTION 
 
 
 This program searches the  $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY  for all objects that currently
exist in a pack file as well as the independent object directories. 
 
 
 All such extra objects are removed. 
 
 
 A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta
compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file. 
 
 
 Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines,
disk storage, etc. 
 
 
 
 
 OPTIONS 
 
 
 
   -n  
   --dry-run  
 
 Donâ€™t actually remove any objects, only show those that would have been
removed. 
 
   -q  
   --quiet  
 
 Squelch the progress indicator.
